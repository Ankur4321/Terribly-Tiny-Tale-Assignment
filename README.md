# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

##   Here is the overview of how the code works:

 The code imports necessary dependencies, including React, useState for managing state, axios for making HTTP requests, and components from the 'recharts' and 'file-saver' packages.

## The component initializes two state variables: data and chartData. data will store the top 20 most frequent words and their frequencies, while chartData will hold the data needed to render the bar chart.

The fetchData function is an asynchronous function triggered when the submit button is clicked. It makes an HTTP GET request to the specified API URL, retrieves the response data, and performs word frequency analysis on it. The frequency analysis involves splitting the text into words, counting the occurrence of each word, and sorting the results to obtain the top 20 most frequent words. The data and chartData states are then updated accordingly.

The handleExport function is called when the export button is clicked. It converts the data array into a CSV string format, creates a Blob from it, and saves it as a CSV file using the saveAs function.

The component's return statement defines the JSX elements to be rendered. It includes an h1 heading, a submit button that triggers the fetchData function, a bar chart component from 'recharts' that is conditionally rendered if chartData exists, and an export button that is conditionally rendered if the data array has a length greater than 0.

I have also used some of the css to style our page

 ## In summary, this component fetches data, performs word frequency analysis, and visualizes the results in a bar chart. It also allows exporting the word frequency data as a CSV file.
